# Ambilight APA102 Nano
This ambilight code works with the APA102 LED strip. The Arduino Nano drives these LED's super fast. It feels like the LED's updates real time.
This is achieved by directly writing inside the Arduino Nano registers and by using the SPI interface.

For the communication with the pc I use prismatik (unofficial)
